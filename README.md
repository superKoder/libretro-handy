**Handy MP for libretro** (libretro-handy-mp)
=============================================

**Handy MP** is a heavily modified version of [libretro-handy](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-handy), which, itself, is a libretro core around [K. Wilkins' original Atari Lynx emultor **Handy**](http://handy.sourceforge.net/). 

> It is work in progress. Patience...

It aims to add local, "couch" split-screen multi-player for many of the original Atari Lynx games. 

You see, a surprisingly large portion of the Lynx' game catalog featured ComLynx multi-player, connecting up to 16 (!) Lynx consoles with a custom 2.5mm jack cable. But because the console wasn't all that popular, most of us never had the pleasure of experiencing these games with a friend... 

That will soon change... stay tuned.
